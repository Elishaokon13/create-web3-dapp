## About
This document provides a set of best practices for open source contributions - bug reports, code submissions / pull requests, etc.

Please read this before starting contributing to ***create-web3-dapp***.

## Submitting bugs

### Due diligence
Before submitting a bug, please perform basic troubleshooting steps:

Make sure you’re on the latest version. If you’re not on the most recent version, your problem may have been solved already! Upgrading is always the best first step.

If you don’t find a pre-existing issue and/or solutions, consider checking on StackOverflow or the [Alchemy Discord Server](https://alchemy.com/discord). 

### What to put in your bug report
Make sure your report gets the attention it deserves: bug reports with missing information may be ignored or punted back to you, delaying a fix. The below constitutes a bare minimum; more info is almost always better:

1. How can the developers recreate the bug on their end?
2. Your NodeJS and npm versions. You can get them by running:
```
npm -v && node -v
```
3. If possible, include a copy of your code, the command you used to invoke it, and the full output of your run (if applicable.)

A common tactic is to pare down your code until a simple (but still bug-causing) “base case” remains. Not only can this help you identify problems which aren’t real bugs, but it means the developer can get to fixing the bug faster.

## Opening an issue
Before submitting a new issue, please perform basic due diligence steps:

Make sure the issue doesn't already exists by searching for it in [ISSUES](https://github.com/Elishaokon13/create-web3-dapp/issues). 

### What to put in your issue

When creating a new issue, make sure to include one of the following tags in the Title:

**[BUG]** - if the issue is being opened to report a bug
**[ENHANCEMENT]** - if the issue is being opened to suggest a new feature or assumed improvement
**[QUESTION]** - any other case

### Tags
Tags make searching for issues faster and create an amazing way for new comers to find **"good-first-issues"**

Good first issues are all issues suited to be picked up by newcomers without deep understanding of the code base and how it works. 

Make sure to tag your issues based on it's content using one of the provided tags. Open an issue to suggest new tags if needed. 

## Contributing changes

### Licensing of contributed material
This project is licensed under MIT license, you can read more about what you can and CAN'T do by [visiting this link](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) 

Anything submitted to this project falls under the licensing terms in the repository’s [top level LICENSE file](https://github.com/Elishaokon13/create-web3-dapp/blob/main/LICENSE).

### Version control branching
Always make a new branch for your work, no matter how small. This makes it easy for others to take just that one set of changes from your repository, in case you have multiple unrelated changes floating around.

A corollary: don’t submit unrelated changes in the same branch/pull request! The maintainer shouldn’t have to reject your awesome bugfix because the feature you put in with it needs more review.

Base your new branch off of the appropriate branch on the main repository.

## Bug Fixes 

Bug fixes should be based on the branch named after the oldest supported release line the bug affects.

E.g. if a feature was introduced in 1.1, the latest release line is 1.3, and a bug is found in that feature - make your branch based on 1.1. The maintainer will then forward-port it to 1.3 and main.

Bug fixes requiring large changes to the code or which have a chance of being otherwise disruptive, may need to base off of master instead - Open an issue in [ISSUES](https://github.com/Elishaokon13/create-web3-dapp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) first

## New Features

New features should branch off of the ‘main’ branch.

Note that depending on how long it takes for the dev team to merge your patch, the copy of main you worked off of may get out of date! If you find yourself ‘bumping’ a pull request that’s been sidelined for a while, make sure you rebase or merge to latest main to ensure a speedier resolution.

## Code formatting

Follow the style you see used in the primary repository! Consistency with the rest of the project always trumps other considerations. It doesn’t matter if you have your own style or if the rest of the code breaks with the greater community - just follow along.

## Opening a Pull Request

PRs without documentation or comments will be returned to sender. By “documentation” we mean:

* List of changes and explanation of them.

New features should ideally include updates to prose documentation, including useful example code snippets.

All submissions should have a changelog entry crediting the contributor and/or any individuals instrumental in identifying the problem.

## Full example

Here’s an example workflow to create a new Pull Request. Your username is yourname and you’re submitting a basic bugfix.

### Preparing your Fork
1. Click ‘Fork’ on Github, creating e.g. eversmile12/create-web3-dapp.
2. Clone your project: git clone git@github.com:eversmile12/create-web3-dapp.
3. cd create-web3-dapp
4. Install the development requirements: npm install.
5. Create a branch: git checkout -b foo-the-bars - Remember to use a branch name that describes WHAT you're doing/fixing.
6. Make your Changes.
7. Hack, hack, hack.
8. Add changelog entry crediting yourself.
9. Commit your changes: git commit -m "Foo the bars".

### Creating Pull Requests
1. Push your commit to get it back up to your fork: git push origin HEAD
2. Visit Github, click handy “Pull request” button that it will make upon noticing your new branch.
3. In the description field, write down issue number (if submitting code fixing an existing issue) or describe the issue + your fix (if submitting a wholly new bugfix).
4. Hit ‘submit’! And please be patient - the maintainers will get to you when they can.

To speed up the process and avoid version clashes, is higly suggested to ask other contributors to see if no one has taken the issue yet. If you're interested in tackling such a feature and it's still available, we will assign you to the task. 

To do so, make sure to join our community on [Discord](alchemy.com/discord).

Feel free to add new issues as you read the code and find inconsistencies and/or possible features that may add up to the website. Follow the labeling standards to make it easier to understand what you're proposing.
